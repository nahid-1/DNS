🧩 PHASE 1 – INSTALL & PREPARE DNS SERVERS
tep 1. Update & Install BIND9 on both servers

On both ns1 & ns2:
>>>>

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc

Check service:
>>>
sudo systemctl status bind9
⚙️ PHASE 2 – CONFIGURE PRIMARY DNS (ns1)
Step 2. Edit /etc/bind/named.conf.options
see the code into  ns1.yaml
Step 3. Define your zones in /etc/bind/named.conf.local

Step 4. Create the forward zone file
Step 5. Create the reverse zone file

Step 6. Restart and verify
✅ If all checks pass, your primary server (ns1) is ready.


🧾 PHASE 4 – ADD A GLUE RECORD

Glue records are A-records placed in the parent zone to resolve nameservers that are within the same domain (e.g., ns1.bronahid.lab for bronahid.lab).

If you use this domain only locally → just ensure:

in your zone file — that’s effectively your local glue record.

If you were registering bronahid.lab publicly, you’d provide these IPs to your domain registrar so they can create glue records in the parent (.lab) zone.
